## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- Advice Slip API

### What I learned

Honestly, this gave me so much trouble. I still can't believe I managed to get through this one. This is my first time working with APIs and I get the feeling this is only scratching the surface of what I can do with them. 

### Continued development

I'd love to continue working with APIs and make things that are more functional, things that I would actually use in my day to day life.

The more I work with JS the more I love what It can do. I'm still not 100% sure that Web Development is for me, but I'm having a lot of fun learning and finding solutions to projects like this one and all the others I will be doing.

### Useful resources

- [Video about Advice Slip API](https://www.example.com) - Since I had absolutely 0 idea of what I was doing this video basically gave me the answer, which I'm not completely proud of, but because of it I feel I understand more of what I'm doing when it comes to APIs and how to use them properly
